            <strong> Darth Vader</strong> (/dɑːrθ veɪdər/) is a fictional
            character in the Star Wars franchise. He was first introduced in the
            original film trilogy as one of the leaders of the Galactic Empire.
            The prequel trilogy chronicles his transformation from the Jedi
            Knight <em> Anakin Skywalker</em> into the
            <strong>Sith Lord Darth Vader</strong>. His metamorphosis begins
            when he is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor
            Palpatine, who later becomes Emperor. After a lightsaber battle with
            his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader is severely injured and is
            transformed into a cyborg. He serves Palpatine for over two decades,
            hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel
            Alliance. When Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son,
            <em>Luke Skywalker</em>, the Sith Lord turns against his master and
            destroys him. Vader is the husband of Padmé Amidala, the father of
            Luke and his twin sister <em>Leia Organa</em>, and the grandfather
            of <em> Ben Solo</em>.[a]

            The films Swiss Family Robinson (1960) and Battle of the Bulge
            (1965) influenced the original Star Wars trilogy, but Lucas's
            publicist has denied that Anakin Skywalker was named after Ken
            Annakin, the director of those films.[27][28] The original surname
            of Anakin and Luke was "Starkiller", and it remained in the script
            until a few months into filming Star Wars. It was dropped due to
            what Lucas called "unpleasant connotations" with Charles Manson, who
            became a "star killer" in 1969 when he murdered the well-known
            actress Sharon Tate.[29][30] Lucas replaced the problematic name
            "Starkiller" with "Skywalker".[31]The Phantom Menace introduced the
            possibility that Anakin could be the Chosen One of an ancient Jedi
            prophecy, who is destined to bring balance to the Force. Lucas
            stated in an interview that "Anakin is the Chosen One. Even when
            Anakin turns into Darth Vader, he is still the Chosen One." Hayden
            Christensen said of Anakin: "He believes that he's the Chosen One.
            He's not doing wrong things knowing that it's having a negative
            impact. So there's that sort of naivety to him ... and it makes him
            more human in a lot of ways.

            After completing principal photography for Revenge of the Sith in
            2003, Lucas made changes to Anakin's character by rewriting his turn
            to the dark side. He accomplished this through editing the principal
            footage and filming new scenes during pickups in London in 2004.In
            previous versions of the script, Anakin had several reasons for
            turning to the dark side, including his sincere belief that the Jedi
            were plotting to seize control of the Republic. Although he retains
            this belief in the finished film, Lucas's changes emphasized his
            desire to rescue Padmé from death. Thus, in the theatrical version
            of Revenge of the Sith, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to
            save Padmé.[34]

            Anakin's voice is heard briefly in the third film of the sequel
            trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker (2019), set 31 years after the events
            of Return of the Jedi. During Rey's confrontation with the
            resurrected Darth Sidious, she hears the voices of various deceased
            Jedi, including Anakin. He encourages her to return balance to the
            Force like he once did.[70][71]In the 2008 animated film The Clone
            Wars, set shortly after the events of Attack of the Clones, Yoda
            assigns Anakin an apprentice, Ahsoka Tano. Anakin is at first
            reluctant to accept this responsibility. He calls Ahsoka "Snips" for
            her "snippy" attitude, while Ahsoka refers to him as "Skyguy".[72]
            After earning Anakin's respect during a dangerous mission, Ahsoka
            joins him on a quest to rescue Jabba the Hutt's infant son, Rotta.
            Her impetuousness both annoys and endears her to Anakin, and he
            develops a friendly affection towards her.

            David Prowse, a 6-foot-6-inch (1.98 m) bodybuilder and actor,
            portrays Vader in the original trilogy. Prowse was originally
            offered the role of Chewbacca, but turned it down, as he wanted to
            play the villain.[36] Bob Anderson, a former Olympic fencer,
            portrays Vader during lightsaber fight scenes in The Empire Strikes
            Back and Return of the Jedi.[37] Lucas chose to have a different
            actor provide Vader's voice, because he felt Prowse's West Country
            English accent was inappropriate for the character.[38] The director
            originally considered Orson Welles for the role, but selected James
            Earl Jones instead after deciding that Welles's voice would be too
            recognizable to audiences.[39][40] Jones initially felt his role was
            too small to warrant recognition, and he chose to be uncredited in
            Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. He was finally credited in
            Return of the Jedi in 1983.[41][38] When filming the scene in The
            Empire Strikes Back in which Vader confesses he is Luke's father,
          </p>
          <p>
            Prowse was given modified dialogue to read that did not exist in the
            script. He was known for repeatedly leaking information to the
            public, and the filmmakers wanted to keep Vader's revelation a
            secret until the film was released.Prowse was asked to read the line
            "Obi-Wan killed your father" instead of
            <strong>"No, I am your father."</strong>[42] Only the director, the
            producers, and Mark Hamill knew the actual line, which was dubbed in
            later by Jones.[42][43] Prowse did not know the real line until he
            viewed the finished film.

          <h3>The Actors Who Played Vader</h3>
          <p>
            David Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy,
            while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and
            some television series. Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin in Return of
            the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray
            Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role
            in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023). In the
            standalone film Rogue One (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer
            Wilding and Daniel Naprous. The character also appears in novels,
            comics, and video games. He has become an iconic villain of
            cinema.[b] [44]Hayden Christensen portrays Vader in Revenge of the
            Sith, while Brock Peters provides his voice in the Star Wars radio
            series.[45][46] Scott Lawrence voices Vader in video games,
            including the 2019 virtual reality series Vader Immortal.[47] Matt
            Sloan voices the Sith Lord in both video games and television
            productions.[48] Both Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous portray
            Vader in Rogue One, with Jones providing the voice.[49] Jones also
            voices Vader in the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) and the
            animated series Star Wars Rebels.[50][51]
            <em> In September 2022</em>, it was confirmed that Jones would
            retire from voicing the character. His voice was digitally recreated
            by the company Respeecher for use in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi, and
            he later signed over the rights to his voice for future Star Wars
            productions.[52][53]
